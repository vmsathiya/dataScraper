The Lunch/Dinner here though wasn’t anywhere up to the mark. Apart from the fish, we had on the first day, both of us were down with food poisoning the next two days with stale chicken dishes!

Swiss_County : 25 : Stay not worth : Located some 15-20 Km away from Munnar town, no facility to commute to and from hotel. They charge you separately. No facilities in the hotel for any recreation. It's only the view which is worth but that every hotel will offer you.

Swiss_County : 32 : Stay at Swiss County hotel : It was a pleasant stay, but they don't have food variety in veg.
Swiss_County : 33 : Great stay in about 30 minutes from Munnar : Stayed at Alpine suite in Swiss county. Suite is a large and clean room. Views from hotel are hills and not Munnar valley with tea estates as we expected but they are great. Even views from room top restaurant are great with hills covered with clouds. Staff are extremely kind and friendly. Kudos for their hospitality 10/10 for that. I would definitely recommend staying at Swiss county unless some one expects Munnar tea estates and valley view from their room.

Swiss_County : 40 : Best value for money hotel in Munnar near Chittirapuram : We stayed in Apline suite room for 3 nights. The room is located beside the reception and is huge room with a balcony has a beautiful view. Staff behaviour - 5/5, Food - 4/5 Coming from Andhra, we liked almost all the dishes they we had tried fish, fried rice, paratha, chapati, veg manchuria, gobhi manchuria, chicken biriyani, almost all breakfast items that they had. You can rely on this hotel for food. Wifi is just ok and TV is too small for the room. All the toiletries are available in the wash room. Overall 5/5.
Swiss_County : 41 : Par excellence : The staff was cooperative and friendly. They attended to all your needs and comfort. The rooms were big, clean and with excellent view. The linen, and room were clean and neat. Worth the money spent

They treated me as their own guest from the start till the last bye. Perfect in room service with no unnecessary disturbances. Security helped me with all local places and planning my trip to Munnar was very easy. Rooms are perfectly clean and exactly as shown in the pictures. Food is costly but no complaints in the quality and service. Even served laundry service, a special request for honeymoon couples, etc!
Swiss_County : 46 : Good Stay : Overall very good hotel service location and quality were very good.
Swiss_County : 47 : A pleasant getaway : Swiss county located at Chithirapuram is a pleasant stay. The rooms with mountain view are quite an experience. The serene, calm locale can soothe your senses. Alphorn restaurant offers food that is tasty and well prepared. The staff is really courteous and well mannered. Go for it. As a couple or family, you will enjoy the stay.
Swiss_County : 48 : Rude manager : My child mistakenly scribbled on the wall and we were to inform the manager about it. But the manager was not at seat in the morning. At evening when we returned he burst out on me that "you will have to pay for that and you should have seen to your child. U haven't informed us". I was an alone lady and my hubby was out for some work. Still, he blasted on me. Very disappointed and not recommend. Need serious apology and I even said that it is just done by pencil we are very sorry for that but he was not ready to listen even.
Swiss_County : 49 : Amazing stay : Great service and hospitality.
Swiss_County : 50 : It was really good. Food was great. Wifi connection is really weak : Just an issue with internet connectivity rest all are awesome
Swiss_County : 51 : Excellent stay : I stayed in alpine suite. The rooms were very comfortable, big and clean added to that excellence. The services was awesome. Positive and friendly staff. Location is good as it is far from the hustle and bustle of Town. Swiss County made me feel like home. The host specially Mr. Beenu was awesome and a very good human being. Food was fantastic. Keep it up Swiss County Munnar.
Swiss_County : 52 : Awesome stay : We booked the alpine suite. And it was amazing. They have super fast room service and even night service so it's basically 24/7. Housekeeping was really good and everyday our room would be fully cleaned and stocked while we were out sightseeing. They provide all amenities like ac, hot water, tissues, dental kit, shaving kit, shower caps and other toiletries. There's a fridge and microwave in the room so we reheated food that was left over from the meal before and thus minimal wastage. The view from the balcony is too good especially since you would literally be waking up to that panorama every morning. The bed's super comfy and there's a couch and tv to lounge in as well. In short, this was the best part of our stay and totally value for money.
Swiss_County : 53 : Nice experience : While booking Swiss County I really not much satisfied but after going to reality totally different experience. Food ambiance the way how staff received totally satisfied 5/5
Swiss_County : 54 : Recommended to others visiting Munnar : Hotel provides scenic view of mountains right from the balcony. Hotel staff and manager was very courteous and made sure that we have comfortable stay. Hotel is around 11 km from City center which actually cuts off any unwanted City traffic and noise. I will definitely recommend this hotel to others visiting Munnar.
Swiss_County : 55 : Great service, staff are really helpful : Our full travel was totally taken care by the hotel. They even had two cycle which they gave us for free. Good breakfast. Lovely view from the balcony
Swiss_County : 56 : The perfect room, extremely friendly hotel staff, and complete vale for money : The Swiss County, like a mini chalet, can boast of a complete family like atmosphere, smiling faces all around and everyone willing to assist you to the best extent possible. The property, both exterior and interior, seems in almost like new condition, very clean and well maintained. The best part of our stay was the Alpine Suite Room. Very large, including a lounge & sitting area, a pantry, bedroom and private balcony. The pantry includes amenities like a microwave, kettle, refrigerator, and a kitchen sink. All basic amenities are provided. The bedroom is just alongside the balcony with full glass sliding doors, and the view from therein is breathtaking too. There are 2 alpine suite rooms, 105 & 106, both with the same construction and view. The hotel can arrange for private tours, and can even call an auto rickshaw if you want a little excursion to the nearby tea estates and view points. The hotel also provides their own bicycles in case you need one. The food is good, served with delight. The chef has mastered continental dishes and thus it was a delight to try both Indian and Continental cuisine. A special mention needs to be made about staff friendliness. It felt like a home, away from home. Every single person, from the hotel manager to the service staff endeavored their best to satisfy the guests in every possible way.
Swiss_County : 57 : Terrific service : Service provided by the hotel was terrific. Rooms were really good but not at all value for money. You could easily get a 5 star hotel at the same price.
Swiss_County : 58 : Happy stay at Swiss County : Scenic view. Delicious vegetarian food. Courteous staff. Overall Nice experience.
Swiss_County : 59 : Excellent Stay : Wow place, a short boutique hotel but huge from inside must visit
Swiss_County : 60 : Excellent Stay : Good food and staff. Nice spacious room and cleanliness
Swiss_County : 61 : Amazing hospitality! : Hotel staff were extremely polite and professional. Especially, Binu and Piyush. Other service staff were good as well. Alpine suite is extremely spacious and luxurious. Although there are couple of areas of improvement. The hotel should install a 43 inch or a bigger television which would go well with the size of the suite. The hotel must connect to a HD set top box and HD channels. World-wide channels should be added, instead of local south indian channels. Another aspect which requires attention is the quality of food. All the chinese and south indian dish tastes alike. The cost of the food is also not so reasonable. However, I will still rate Swiss County as one of my best stay in Kerala so far.
Swiss_County : 62 : Good : The overall experience at Swiss County was good!
Swiss_County : 63 : Good Stay : Very peaceful place and good food.
Swiss_County : 64 : Great stay at Swiss County : Good spacious rooms. Nice food. Staff are friendly and helpful. In future also I will prefer Swiss County in my Munnar visit
Swiss_County : 65 : It was just ok : Location view and staff were good. Room need upgradation. Need maintenance for room paint, bathroom and electrical appliances.
Swiss_County : 66 : Tidy setup with a picturesque view from the balcony : Location you get a breathtaking view of the mountains from your balcony. It was worth every bit of the penny. My family loved it. 5/5 for the location. Food you need to expand your data log. Not sure why the buffet offering was missing while we could see the setup in the restaurant. Service we had to ask the staff for the basics like hot water, movement of bags. Management must take proactive measures to improve their score on such experiences.
Swiss_County : 67 : Excellent : Alpine suite is very spacious.
Swiss_County : 68 : Excellent Stay : It's an excellent experience.
Swiss_County : 69 : Excellent Stay : If u are with family this hotel is best for you. Specially the view and the staff very humble and polite and service is excellent also very good food. Go for it without any hesitation.
Swiss_County : 70 : Excellent Stay : Nice hotel, no pool, little disappointed with kids playing area
Swiss_County : 71 : Not a great place to spend holidays : The location of the hotel is quite far from town and is at a very lonely place with no restaurant or shops nearby. No place in the hotel nor nearby to roam around in the evening. The area is totally deserted after 10 Pm. Deluxe (without balcony) rooms are terrible as they are in basement and no view from windows. They are a big no for anyone wants to spend a holiday at a good hotel. Hotel has only 8 rooms and has no recreational facilities. This should not be a not a good star hotel. Staff is polite and service is good.
Swiss_County : 72 : Good hotel, good food and pleasant location : Good hotel, good food and pleasant location
Swiss_County : 73 : Good Stay : Everything can be rated as average and description of hotel amenities must be made clear like minibar but all paid drinks, cookies they charge it. It needs a good briefing. Overall good.

Swiss_County : 91 : Simply amazing stay : Swiss county lives up to its ratings and reviews, it was truly a wonderful experience there. The room, staff, food and hospitality is surely 5/5. The manager is very genuine and helpful person and took care of all the basics during our stay. We stayed in suite which has all the amenities and amazing view. The food and hospitality is exceptional. Its 20 minutes away from Munnar Town and gives you calm and clean vibes. Don't compare it with big hotel chains but for a quite and warm stay choose this place with eyes closed. I will recommend this place to all travelers who likes a break from busy life's and wants to enjoy a beautiful stay.
Swiss_County : 92 : A five star service in budget : We stayed for two days and we can not ask for a better experience for our Kerala trip. Staff was courteous, prompt service and specially the suits.

Swiss_County : 96 : Average stay. Feel like home stays : Feel like home stays. 12 km from munnar main town. Hotel location exactly on the main road. Very costly buffet. Hotel has only 7 rooms. Staff is very good. Very large balconies. The location of Swiss county is not so good. It's 12 km before munnar main town. Moreover, the pictures shown by hotel are really attractive, but actually it's not so good. In pictures, it looks like the entire outside area is private property of hotel, but no. It's on the main road. Rooms balconies are very good and spacious and opens towards valley. Staff is very good but buffet is very costly. No other facilities in hotel. You will feel more like home stays not a proper hotel.

Swiss_County : 135 : Room, food and service : It's definitely a value for money stay. Room is definitely a premium one. Good size bed and a decent view from the balcony food is also good service is also good.
Swiss_County : 136 : It was amazing hotel. Small : It was amazing hotel. Small property having only 7 rooms but exceptionally clean and good. Rooms were super spacious and with clean and big washrooms. Hill view balcony and garden view entrance if you take ground floor. The only thing I didn't like is if you stay at ground floor and want to go roof top restaurant so there is NO LIFT in the hotel. I think that too manageable but depending on personal choice and 2nd thing food preparation smell was too strong in the Stairs area. Room service was a
Swiss_County : 137 : Not good at all, food service is pathetic, far away : Hotel is far away from Munnar town, no nearby facilities available, food service is pathetic and the attitude of food guy is pathetic, rest of the staff is fine, don't serve anything in night, so please people stay away from this
Swiss_County : 138 : Exquisite is the word : I wanted to give 6 for extremely well trained and courteous staff. The location is good but rest all things are more than perfect. Located very close to top view points in Munnar. View from hotel is not breathtaking but satisfying
Swiss_County : 139 : Modern room with good facilities. : Rooms are neat and service is good. You can make use of cycles as well which is available in the resort itself. The pics uploaded here are of Alpine suite. People looking for relaxation can opt for this resort as it is 8 km away from Munnar town.
Swiss_County : 140 : Exceptionally good place to stay : It is a Very good place to stay. Reasonable distance from all the 'to go' places. Food is exceptionally good at their costs. I have been to 'the Panoramic View ' Lounge in Munnar which is a very good lounge but a bit costly. I thought I got the same quality food in Swiss County hotel for a cheaper cost, although the Menu here is limited. The view from there is mind blowing. We get a very good view. Their interiors design of the rooms and their decoration with lily flowers is praiseworthy. They could take care of the smell of the lily flowers if possible, all people may not like the smell all the time. Just a suggestion, in case. But the Overall stay was amazing.
Swiss_County : 141 : Fantastic stay in Munnar : Staying in the resort obviously adds extra value to your trip. The resort earns full marks in every parameter and in every aspects right from services to food qualities, hospitality, panoramic views from the balcony and the roof. In the entire trip starting from Kochi to Kovalam we had the best stay in this resort and really delighted that we selected Swiss County in our itinerary. The resort is extremely cosy and compact. I would suggest every travellers to keep Swiss County at top of the chart while searching accommodation in Munnar.
Swiss_County : 142 : Superb room : The room was very nice and the staff was also very helpful. They arranged for a cake at 12 of my husband's birthday but the location is a little far from Munnar station and the temperature is a little high here

Swiss_County : 149 : Only +ve about this hotel is the view from room : I booked this hotel based on the great ratings of this hotel given at trip advisor but I was disappointed with the poor service and lack of facilities at this hotel. Main disadvantages are mentioned below: 1) This hotel doesn't have any lift. Only stairs. Definitely not suitable for senior citizens or disabled persons. It was too inconvenient for my mother due to her old age. 2) No staff at reception before 7 AM. This is the hotel's rule. So if you face any problem during early morning hours, you'll have to wait till 7 or 7:30 AM till someone resumes his duty at reception. 3) The hotel had problems with hot water and water pressure was too low in the shower. 4) This hotel provides 1 bottle of drinking water per person in a day. We were a 3 members family and the hotel provided us with 3 bottles of water in a day. If you need more water then you need to buy it from the hotel or bring it from outside. This is the strict policy of this hotel and they won't provide more than 1 bottle of water for free to each guest in a day. 5) The location of this hotel is not good at all. Reaching to this hotel is a too difficult task itself. Very narrow and dangerous road.
